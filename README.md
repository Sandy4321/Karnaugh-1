I just like Karnaugh maps. I've used them to help me create redstone circuitry in Minecraft before. I have never thrown much code at it which has resulted in me making 16 x 16 tables. 

There isn't really a direction this is going yet but I have a rough outline of what I want this to do.

I guess there's also a testing module now.
